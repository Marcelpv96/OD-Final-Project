# OD-Project


# 1st STEP 

  - Define our goal: App Recommender.

  - Define our kind of graph: Knowledge graph.

  - Define our Sources: 
      - http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html

      - https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/android-apps


# 2nd STEP (we do not have to program anything, if we do it we will get 2 points more)

  - Design the integration schema: look something like slides 12-data integration slide 10. Also look set of slides 13-data integration
  
  - Design the data flows: how we will deal with entity resolution (look in DW slides), how we will deal with the problem of diferent types of data sources, we have 2, one csv and one json.
  
  - The aim here is  write 'develop' something general, not only something 'hardcoded' that only works with this specific sources
